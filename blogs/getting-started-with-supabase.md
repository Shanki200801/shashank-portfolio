# Getting Started with Supabase: A Firebase Alternative That Just Works

As a full stack developer, I've worked with numerous backend solutions and database systems over the years. For quick prototypes and MVPs, Firebase has been a reliable choice in my toolkit. However, I recently discovered [Supabase](https://supabase.com), an open-source Firebase alternative, and it has completely transformed my development workflow.

In this post, I'll share my experience using Supabase for a simple project and compare it with Firebase from a full stack developer's perspective.

## What is Supabase?

Supabase is an open-source Firebase alternative that provides all the backend services you need to build a product:

- **PostgreSQL Database**: A full Postgres database with real-time capabilities
- **Authentication**: User management with multiple auth providers
- **Storage**: Store and serve large files
- **Edge Functions**: Run serverless functions
- **Realtime**: Build real-time applications

The best part? It's built on top of PostgreSQL, which means you get the power and flexibility of a proper relational database instead of a NoSQL database like Firebase's Firestore. As someone who's comfortable writing custom backend code, I appreciate having access to the full power of SQL when needed.

## Setting Up My Project with Supabase

For my latest side project—a simple task management app—I needed authentication, database storage for tasks, and file storage for attachments. Here's how easy it was to get started with Supabase.

### Quick Setup Using Templates

Supabase offers several starter templates that make it incredibly easy to get up and running. I used their Next.js template:

```bash
npx create-next-app -e with-supabase my-task-app
cd my-task-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

That's it! In less than 5 minutes, I had a fully functional Next.js app with Supabase integration. The template comes with:

- Authentication already set up
- TypeScript support
- Environment variables configured
- Basic UI components

As a full stack developer, I'm used to spending hours configuring backends, setting up authentication flows, and connecting everything together. With Supabase, I could skip straight to building the actual application logic.

### Setting Up Authentication

Adding authentication to my app was surprisingly simple. Supabase provides a pre-built Auth UI component that handles all the complex parts:

```jsx
import { Auth } from '@supabase/auth-ui-react'
import { ThemeSupa } from '@supabase/auth-ui-shared'
import { createClientComponentClient } from '@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs'

const supabase = createClientComponentClient()

const LoginPage = () => (
  <Auth
    supabaseClient={supabase}
    appearance={{ theme: ThemeSupa }}
    providers={['google', 'github']}
  />
)

export default LoginPage
```

With just this code, I had a complete authentication system with:
- Email/password login
- Magic link authentication
- Social logins (Google, GitHub)
- Password recovery

While I could have built this authentication system from scratch, Supabase saved me days of work implementing secure auth flows, token management, and social provider integrations.

### Database Setup

Setting up my database was equally straightforward. Using the Supabase dashboard, I created tables for my tasks with proper relationships:

1. Created a `tasks` table with columns for title, description, due_date, and user_id
2. Set up Row Level Security (RLS) policies to ensure users can only access their own tasks
3. Created a foreign key relationship between tasks and users

The SQL for my table looked like this:

```sql
CREATE TABLE tasks (
  id UUID DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4() PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users NOT NULL,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  due_date TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  completed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Set up Row Level Security
ALTER TABLE tasks ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create policy for users to see only their tasks
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own tasks" 
  ON tasks FOR SELECT 
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Create policy for users to insert their own tasks
CREATE POLICY "Users can create their own tasks" 
  ON tasks FOR INSERT 
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

As someone comfortable with SQL, I appreciated being able to write custom queries when needed, while still having the convenience of Supabase's client libraries for common operations:

```jsx
const fetchTasks = async () => {
  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from('tasks')
    .select('*')
    .order('due_date', { ascending: true })
  
  if (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching tasks:', error)
    return
  }
  
  setTasks(data)
}
```

### File Storage for Attachments

For task attachments, I used Supabase Storage. Setting up a bucket for file uploads was just a few clicks in the dashboard, and the client-side code was equally simple:

```jsx
const uploadAttachment = async (file) => {
  const fileName = `${Math.random().toString(36).substring(2)}-${file.name}`
  
  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .storage
    .from('task-attachments')
    .upload(`public/${fileName}`, file)
  
  if (error) {
    console.error('Error uploading file:', error)
    return null
  }
  
  return data.path
}
```

Having built custom file upload systems before, I know how much work goes into handling uploads securely, managing permissions, and serving files efficiently. Supabase's storage solution handled all of this for me.

## Why Supabase Beats Firebase for My Needs

After using both Firebase and Supabase, here are the key advantages I found with Supabase as a full stack developer:

### 1. SQL vs NoSQL

Supabase uses PostgreSQL, which means I can use SQL queries, joins, and all the power of a relational database. Firebase's NoSQL approach often led to data duplication and complex queries. As someone who's worked with both SQL and NoSQL databases professionally, having a proper relational database is a huge advantage for most applications.

### 2. Local Development

Supabase can be run locally using Docker, which makes development much easier. Firebase's emulators are good but not as seamless. Being able to run the entire stack locally is crucial for my development workflow.

### 3. Pricing Model

Supabase has a more predictable pricing model, especially for read-heavy applications. Firebase's pricing can escalate quickly as your app grows. Having deployed production applications on both platforms, I've found Supabase's pricing to be more sustainable in the long run.

### 4. Open Source

Being open-source means I can self-host Supabase if needed, which is great for projects with specific compliance requirements. As a full stack developer who often works on enterprise projects, this flexibility is invaluable.

### 5. Row Level Security

Supabase's Row Level Security is implemented at the database level, making it more robust and easier to reason about than Firebase's security rules. Having worked with custom authorization systems, I appreciate how Supabase makes security both powerful and straightforward.

## Cost Comparison: Supabase vs Firebase

Here's a breakdown of the costs for both services:

| Feature | Supabase | Firebase |
|---------|----------|----------|
| **Free Tier Database** | 500MB | 1GB |
| **Free Tier Storage** | 1GB | 5GB |
| **Free Auth Users** | Unlimited | 10,000 |
| **Database Reads** | Unlimited | 50,000/day then $0.06/100,000 |
| **Database Writes** | Unlimited | 20,000/day then $0.18/100,000 |
| **Realtime Connections** | 200 concurrent | Unlimited (but priced separately) |
| **Paid Plans Start** | $25/month | Pay-as-you-go |
| **Self-hosting Option** | Yes | No |

While Firebase offers more in some areas of the free tier, Supabase's unlimited database operations make it more cost-effective for apps with high read/write volumes. For my task app, which has frequent database operations, Supabase's pricing model is much more favorable.

## Conclusion

As a full stack developer who's built custom backends and worked with various BaaS solutions, I was genuinely impressed with Supabase. Setting up authentication, database, and storage took me less than a day, compared to the several days it would have taken with a custom backend or even with Firebase.

The developer experience is excellent, the documentation is clear, and the PostgreSQL foundation gives me confidence that my app can scale. I still have the flexibility to write custom backend code when needed, but Supabase handles all the common patterns so elegantly that I rarely need to.

If you're starting a new project and need backend services, I highly recommend giving Supabase a try. The combination of ease of use, powerful features, and cost-effectiveness makes it a compelling choice for developers of all skill levels.
