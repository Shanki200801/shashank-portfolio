# Getting Started with Next.js

Next.js is a React framework that enables server-side rendering, static site generation, and more. It's a powerful tool for building modern web applications.

## Why Next.js?

Next.js provides several benefits over a traditional React application:

- **Server-side rendering**: Improves performance and SEO
- **Static site generation**: Pre-renders pages at build time for even better performance
- **API routes**: Build API endpoints as part of your Next.js application
- **File-based routing**: Create pages by adding files to the `pages` directory
- **Built-in CSS and Sass support**: Import CSS files directly in your components

## Setting Up a Next.js Project

Getting started with Next.js is easy. Here's how:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

This will create a new Next.js project and start the development server.

## Creating Pages

In Next.js, pages are React components exported from files in the `pages` directory. Each page is associated with a route based on its filename.

For example, to create a page at `/about`, you would create a file at `pages/about.js`:

```jsx
export default function About() {
  return <div>About Page</div>
}
```

## Conclusion

Next.js is a powerful framework for building modern web applications. It provides a great developer experience while ensuring your applications are performant and SEO-friendly.
