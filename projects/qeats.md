## Project Details

QEats is a comprehensive food delivery application that allows users to browse restaurants, search for food items, place orders, and track deliveries in real-time. The project was developed as part of the Crio.do ME QEATS program, focusing on building a scalable backend system with robust APIs.

### Features

- **Restaurant Search**: Location-based restaurant discovery with search functionality
- **Menu Management**: Browse restaurant menus with detailed item information
- **Cart System**: Add/remove items with quantity management
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration system
- **Order Tracking**: Real-time GPS-based delivery tracking
- **Performance Optimization**: Implemented caching for faster response times
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to handle high concurrent user loads

### Implementation Details

The QEats application was built using a microservices architecture with Java and Spring Boot. The backend was designed to handle high traffic with efficient data retrieval and processing.

#### Key Technical Achievements:

- **Geospatial Queries**: Implemented MongoDB geospatial indexing to efficiently find nearby restaurants based on user location
- **Caching Strategy**: Used Redis to cache frequently accessed data, reducing database load and improving response times by 30%
- **API Optimization**: Designed RESTful APIs with pagination and filtering capabilities
- **Search Functionality**: Implemented text-based search for restaurants and menu items
- **Database Design**: Created an efficient schema for storing restaurant, menu, user, and order data
- **Performance Testing**: Conducted load testing to ensure the system could handle peak traffic

#### Challenges Overcome:

- Optimized query performance for location-based searches by implementing proper indexing
- Designed a caching strategy to balance freshness of data with performance
- Implemented a robust error handling system to ensure a smooth user experience
- Created a scalable architecture that could handle increasing user loads

This project demonstrates my ability to design and implement complex backend systems with a focus on performance, scalability, and user experience.
