## Project Details

This project was completed as part of the British Airways Data Science Virtual Experience Programme on The Forage platform. The program consisted of two main tasks: web scraping and sentiment analysis of customer reviews, and building a predictive model for customer booking behavior.

### Features

- **Web Scraping**: Automated extraction of customer reviews from Skytrax
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Natural language processing to analyze customer sentiment
- **Topic Modeling**: Identification of key themes in customer feedback
- **Data Visualization**: Comprehensive visual analysis of customer sentiment trends
- **Predictive Modeling**: Machine learning model to predict customer booking behavior
- **Feature Engineering**: Creation of relevant features from raw customer data
- **Model Evaluation**: Rigorous assessment of model performance with various metrics

### Implementation Details

This project was implemented using Python with a focus on data science libraries. The work was divided into two main tasks, each addressing different aspects of data analysis for the airline industry.

#### Task 1: Customer Review Analysis

- **Data Collection**: Scraped customer reviews from Skytrax using BeautifulSoup and Requests
- **Text Preprocessing**: Cleaned and prepared text data for analysis using NLTK
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Applied NLP techniques to determine customer sentiment
- **Topic Extraction**: Used Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify key themes
- **Insight Generation**: Created visualizations to communicate findings effectively
- **Business Recommendations**: Developed actionable insights based on customer feedback

#### Task 2: Predictive Modeling

- **Data Exploration**: Performed exploratory data analysis on customer booking data
- **Feature Engineering**: Created relevant features from raw customer information
- **Model Selection**: Evaluated multiple classification algorithms
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimized model parameters for best performance
- **Performance Evaluation**: Assessed model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- **Business Impact Analysis**: Quantified the potential business value of the predictive model

This project demonstrates my ability to apply data science techniques to real-world business problems, from data collection and preprocessing to advanced analysis and predictive modeling. The work showcases both technical skills in Python and data science libraries, as well as business acumen in translating findings into actionable recommendations.
